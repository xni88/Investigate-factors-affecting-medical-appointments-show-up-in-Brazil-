# Investigate-factors-affecting-medical-appointments-show-up-in-Brazil-
The dataset that I have chosen called No-show appointment. This dataframe includes total 110527 rows and 14 columns. From the data, I can see that patients sometimes did not show up for their scheduled appointments. What are the major reasons for their missing the appointments? By analyzing the dataframe, I want to find out what factors may be related to patientsâ€™ absence of their medical appointments. After looking at the data, the following questions are the ones that I want to address.

1) See which neighborhood is related to the most appointment show up.

2) See if message reminder is related to appointment show up.
